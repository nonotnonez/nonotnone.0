#### Is TikTok right for my business?
- TikTok has quickly become one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. Everyone from college kids to musicians and celebrities to entrepreneurs are on it. If you're a little bit skeptical about TikTok, I get it. But here's the thing, there's room for everyone on TikTok. 
- And in this course, I'm going to show you how to carve out a unique and memorable space for your business.
- As a professional in my 40s I'm probably not the first person that comes to mind when you think of TikTok creators, but starting in mid 2021 by consistently sharing career advice I wish I'd known sooner in the form of hacks, role plays and stories, I've had exciting results I wouldn't have dreamed of. Paying it forward in this way has led to a highly engaged and loyal community of hundreds of thousands of followers, several TikToks going viral and coverage by international media outlets.
-  A highlight of my journey was getting recognized as one of the best career content creators by fast company. And you know what? There's so much opportunity for you and your business on TikTok. Together, we'll explore achievable and beneficial ways to create and engage on TikTok not by thinking like a traditional advertiser but by thinking like a creator.

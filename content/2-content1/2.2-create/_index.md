#### Developing a content strategy
-  Have you ever watched an enjoyable or compelling video and immediately thought, how did that creator come up with that on the spot? Here's a news flash.
-  For so many creators and business owners, great content is deliberate, it's thought out, it's often not improvised. 
-  Now that doesn't mean there's not room for spontaneity as a business creator, but I want to encourage you to open yourself up to developing a content strategy. In other words, a plan for how to create a **mix of different content**.
-  Remember, **posting consistently** on TikTok is one of the most important factors in keeping your videos **flourishing and distributed**.
-  To help achieve that, I recommend **planning out your content in two-week** increments. 
-  From there, I like to break my content into three primary forms of content: **Trends**, which as you know, are things like **hashtags** and **sounds** already gaining momentum on TikTok. Evergreen, content that adds value on subjects that are always **relevant and useful**. And current news. 
   -  `For example`, headlines or major announcements in an industry. I recommend devoting roughly 25% of your time to **trends** and **news** each, and 50% of your time on **evergreen content**.

-  Here's a look at what my content strategy looks like following this formula.
-  By divvying up your content in this way, you create variety and originality in your videos. 
-  And don't forget, within each category, you have the opportunity to mix things up even more
   -  `For example`, with my evergreen content, I might share tips speaking directly to the camera for one TikTok, but in another video showing an email hack, I might do a screen recording.
-  Similarly, within a trend, I might do a simulated role play. While in another video, I might stitch my own idea together with another creator's. 
-  The different ways to vary your content are limitless.
-  Follow these content strategy techniques and you'll ensure that your page stays in growth mode.
-  As you strategize, keep in mind, you do not, I repeat, do not have to get it flawless. Instead, move forward and do it with speed. A **good plan today** is better than a perfect plan tomorrow.

#### Understand TikTok's algorithm

- When I say algorithm, I mean the digital recommendation system that puts new videos in front of users.
- For first-time users, the app asks you to **select categories of interests**, like pets or travel, to help tailor recommendations to your preferences. 
- This allows the app to **develop an initial feed of recommended content**, and it will start to **polish and refine recommendations based on your interactions with an early set of videos.**
- It's important to know **what factors impact the algorithm** so you can strengthen your TikTok strategy. 
- Keep in mind, though, while there's not one magic bullet to going viral on TikTok, understanding and leveraging **TikTok's algorithm** preferences can really help **expand your reach**. 
- The first component of the algorithm to understand is **user interactions**. 
  - These include the videos you like or share, accounts you follow, comments you post, and content you create.
  
- The second component of the **algorithm** that matters is **video information**.
  - These are things like hashtags, sounds, and the captions that go below your video.
  
- The third component that factors into the algorithm is **device and account settings**.
  - These are things like your language preference, country setting and device type. 

- These factors are included to make sure the system is optimized for performance, but they receive lower weight in the recommendation system relative to other data points, since users don't actively express these as preferences.  
- Knowing that those factors matter, I encourage you to maximize the aspects you can control. 
- **For example**, adding hashtags thoughtfully to ensure the right people find your content and to jump into the pool of trends early on, or noticing the length of videos your audience most likes so you can replicate that length in the future.
- Remember, for both you and your audience, **every new interaction helps the system learn about your interests and suggest content**.
- So the best way to curate your For You feed is to simply use and enjoy the app, to engage in content you're drawn to, and to follow new accounts that you like
- Over time, your For You feed should increasingly be able to surface recommendations that are relevant to your interests.

#### Create best practices

- TikTok users aren't expecting to have to rotate their screen to watch their next video.
- So the simple rule of thumb here is to capture your **videos vertically**. That allows you to take maximum advantage of TikTok's full screen experience
  - Use tripod
  - Video resolution
  - Audio : Tiktok library
  - Video length 
    - TikTok reports that shorter videos perform better. In fact, one in four top performing videos have a duration between **21 and 34 seconds**.
  - Caption

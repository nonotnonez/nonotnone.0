#### Benefits of creating on TikTok
- The first benefit is that TikTok has a huge, rapidly growing audience. 
- It creates an **anti-marketing** marketing strategy, meaning it doesn't feel salesy.
- A powerful kind of focus group for your business.
- The benefits of bringing your business to TikTok are many. This is the perfect time to share your knowledge and experience, to build a sense of community, to open yourself up to unexpected connections and relationships, let's do this!

#### Identifying your authentic creator persona
When you're wondering whether or not to develop or post certain content, here are some ways to get started.

1- Consider what **three words** should come to mind for your audience after consuming your content.

|  1- Three words| 2- Example |
|---|---|
|![21][1]| Consider what **three words** should come to mind : Mission - Promise - Pillars|
|![21][2]| as someone who shares career and leadership advice : Informed - Self-Configdent - Inspired |
|![21][3]| for a high-end fashion brand for men though: Smart - Fresh - Stylish |

**2- Indentify your unique zone of genious.**
  - Whether it's developing from scratch multilingual mobile apps or unforgettable guided hikes for the over 50 crowd. It's important to distill your specialty down to its essence.
    - Example:  While I focus on career development, my specific zone of genius is in helping people stand up for themselves at work
    
**3- What's your supperpower?**
  - How would that sound in just five to seven words? Take a moment to reflect and write down your responses. Which leads us to your target audience. Who is your product, service or content geared to?
    - Example: My own target audience is primarily female professionals. So I factor that heavily in my content. 
      - For Dove, for example, their target audience is 18 to 35 year old women who value natural, healthy beauty products.
      - For a company like Nike though, it's a much broader target audience, men, women, and kids spanning 15 to 55 years old.
  - What is it for you? Take a moment to write down your target audience.

**4- Consider delivery**
  - As you think about the core problems you want to help your audience solve, consider who they'd most like to go to for help. Then I'd like you to answer this question. How would they want that person to solve their problem? 
  - With the familiarity of a friend, with the rigor and knowledge of a professor, with seriousness or humor and levity?
  - Jot that down now and then add what aesthetics, movements, or musical choices could enhance that delivery.
  - Realize that, according to Harvard Business School, **95% of purchasing decisions are based on feelings, not logic.** Your audience is looking for brands that feel relatable and speak to their gut.
  - So this is your opportunity to share your best work in the most human and personal way. Go forth and use your personality to stand out.

#### Setting up your accounts 

TikTok has two main types of accounts, personal and business, both of which are free.

|  Persional |  Bussiness |
|---|---|
| make up the majority of TikTok accounts | the ideal format for business owners |
| work well for the average creator, contributing content for their own enjoyment or leisure | offer access to different tools like sales and commerce features  |
|---|the ability to message people you're not friends with, and advanced performance metrics and audience insights.|

As someone looking to grow your business, I encourage you to open a business account.

Setting up your TikTok business account can be accomplished in three quick steps.
- Download the TikTok app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Once the app is installed on your phone, tap to open it. Tap me in the bottom menu bar. Then click sign up to register with your phone number, email address, or registered social media account.
  - One other important thing that you'll be asked to do is enter your TikTok username. Now this might seem like a minor thing, but it's not. You want to make sure your username is memorable and links to your brand or identity
  - In my case, I use my full name as my username. But in your case, it may make sense to use your brand or company name. What I'd encourage you to avoid is putting user6834 or adding a username totally unrelated to your business or brand. 

#### Choosing accounts to follow

- Explore three essential categories of accounts to include in your feed.
- Starting with categories such as competitive businesses, industry giants, and a miscellaneous motley crew can help as a first step. 
  - That way, as you start out, you'll find it easier to make informed, quick choices about who to follow and why it'll add value. 
  - So take a moment now to think of four to six competitors who do **similar work** as you, and search if they have a presence on TikTok, and follow them, voila
  - A second category of creators to consider following are **industry giants**.These are a larger, more mature, or more successful businesses who operate in your same space.Following these business brands can catalyze **new ideas** and act as a **time saver** for helping you stay up on new products or developments. 
  
- Take some time now to come up with four to six giants in your industry, and search for and follow them on TikTok. And finally, it's important to follow what I call a motley crew.
  - These are people that represent a mix of backgrounds and styles. Their content may stimulate, entertain, or inform you.
  - **For me**, this involves following those who create content about my personal interests, like weightlifting, cooking, music, even celebrities of interest.
  - It also includes people who have nothing to do with my business, but whose content engages, excites, or challenges me, such as friends.
    
-  By diversifying the perspectives you're hearing in this way, it can make you more creative, help you see other viewpoints of users and creators, and stimulate new ways to present your content.
-  Take some time now to seek out your motley crew, taking into account your friends, hobbies, interests, and more. Follow four to six of these individuals now.
-  By taking an active hand in whose content appears in your feed, you're being more **strategic with your time and energy**.

#### Understanding trends    
- A TikTok trend can be a sound, hashtag, dance, or challenge
- In fact, even the type of transition you use when you edit your video can become a trend.
- This matters because TikTok gives preference to trending TikTok videos, which can translate to more views and engagement if you jump on a trend.
- Once a trend starts to gain traction, users hop on it by reinterpreting or recreating it, and then posting that content in a timely way.
- As a business participating in and leveraging trends allows you to use existing momentum to **share your authentic brand voice**.
- It lets you show some **personality**, get more **exposure**, and in my experience, is one of the most fun aspects of the app.
- And here's my favorite benefit:
  - It helps you diversify your content without having to come up with a unique video idea from scratch. 
- Do you get a sense of the range of ways to adapt a trend to fit your business?
- I recommend checking this page each time you go to the app so you can see what's new and timely, and know that some trends simply won't jive with you or your work, and that's okay.
- But if one does grab your interest, here are a a few quick questions you can ask yourself
  - What's the core issue or experience being communicated in this trend? 
  - Does my audience deal with an experience like this?
  - How can I show relatability or share resources or a solution when it comes to their experience?
- Remember, **trends draw large audiences** of **highly engaged people**. By getting involved, you can **amplify your brand voice and bolster your reach**. It's time to make your presence felt.

	"content": "Benefits of creating on TikTok The first benefit is that TikTok has a huge, rapidly growing audience. It creates an anti-marketing marketing strategy, meaning it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel salesy. A powerful kind of focus group for your business. The benefits of bringing your business to TikTok are many. This is the perfect time to share your knowledge and experience, to build a sense of community, to open yourself up to unexpected connections and relationships, let\u0026rsquo;s do this! Identifying your authentic creator persona When you\u0026rsquo;re wondering whether or not to develop or post certain content, here are some ways to get started.\n1- Consider what three words should come to mind for your audience after consuming your content.\n1- Three words 2- Example Consider what three words should come to mind : Mission - Promise - Pillars as someone who shares career and leadership advice : Informed - Self-Configdent - Inspired for a high-end fashion brand for men though: Smart - Fresh - Stylish 2- Indentify your unique zone of genious.\nWhether it\u0026rsquo;s developing from scratch multilingual mobile apps or unforgettable guided hikes for the over 50 crowd. It\u0026rsquo;s important to distill your specialty down to its essence. Example: While I focus on career development, my specific zone of genius is in helping people stand up for themselves at work 3- What\u0026rsquo;s your supperpower?\nHow would that sound in just five to seven words? Take a moment to reflect and write down your responses. Which leads us to your target audience. Who is your product, service or content geared to? Example: My own target audience is primarily female professionals. So I factor that heavily in my content. For Dove, for example, their target audience is 18 to 35 year old women who value natural, healthy beauty products. For a company like Nike though, it\u0026rsquo;s a much broader target audience, men, women, and kids spanning 15 to 55 years old. What is it for you? Take a moment to write down your target audience. 4- Consider delivery\nAs you think about the core problems you want to help your audience solve, consider who they\u0026rsquo;d most like to go to for help. Then I\u0026rsquo;d like you to answer this question. How would they want that person to solve their problem? With the familiarity of a friend, with the rigor and knowledge of a professor, with seriousness or humor and levity? Jot that down now and then add what aesthetics, movements, or musical choices could enhance that delivery. Realize that, according to Harvard Business School, 95% of purchasing decisions are based on feelings, not logic. Your audience is looking for brands that feel relatable and speak to their gut. So this is your opportunity to share your best work in the most human and personal way. Go forth and use your personality to stand out. Setting up your accounts TikTok has two main types of accounts, personal and business, both of which are free.\nPersional Bussiness make up the majority of TikTok accounts the ideal format for business owners work well for the average creator, contributing content for their own enjoyment or leisure offer access to different tools like sales and commerce features \u0026mdash; the ability to message people you\u0026rsquo;re not friends with, and advanced performance metrics and audience insights. As someone looking to grow your business, I encourage you to open a business account.\nSetting up your TikTok business account can be accomplished in three quick steps.\nDownload the TikTok app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Once the app is installed on your phone, tap to open it. Tap me in the bottom menu bar. Then click sign up to register with your phone number, email address, or registered social media account. One other important thing that you\u0026rsquo;ll be asked to do is enter your TikTok username. Now this might seem like a minor thing, but it\u0026rsquo;s not. You want to make sure your username is memorable and links to your brand or identity In my case, I use my full name as my username. But in your case, it may make sense to use your brand or company name. What I\u0026rsquo;d encourage you to avoid is putting user6834 or adding a username totally unrelated to your business or brand. Choosing accounts to follow Explore three essential categories of accounts to include in your feed.\nStarting with categories such as competitive businesses, industry giants, and a miscellaneous motley crew can help as a first step.\nThat way, as you start out, you\u0026rsquo;ll find it easier to make informed, quick choices about who to follow and why it\u0026rsquo;ll add value. So take a moment now to think of four to six competitors who do similar work as you, and search if they have a presence on TikTok, and follow them, voila A second category of creators to consider following are industry giants.These are a larger, more mature, or more successful businesses who operate in your same space.Following these business brands can catalyze new ideas and act as a time saver for helping you stay up on new products or developments. Take some time now to come up with four to six giants in your industry, and search for and follow them on TikTok. And finally, it\u0026rsquo;s important to follow what I call a motley crew.\nThese are people that represent a mix of backgrounds and styles. Their content may stimulate, entertain, or inform you. For me, this involves following those who create content about my personal interests, like weightlifting, cooking, music, even celebrities of interest. It also includes people who have nothing to do with my business, but whose content engages, excites, or challenges me, such as friends. By diversifying the perspectives you\u0026rsquo;re hearing in this way, it can make you more creative, help you see other viewpoints of users and creators, and stimulate new ways to present your content.\nTake some time now to seek out your motley crew, taking into account your friends, hobbies, interests, and more. Follow four to six of these individuals now.\nBy taking an active hand in whose content appears in your feed, you\u0026rsquo;re being more strategic with your time and energy.\nUnderstanding trends A TikTok trend can be a sound, hashtag, dance, or challenge In fact, even the type of transition you use when you edit your video can become a trend. This matters because TikTok gives preference to trending TikTok videos, which can translate to more views and engagement if you jump on a trend. Once a trend starts to gain traction, users hop on it by reinterpreting or recreating it, and then posting that content in a timely way. As a business participating in and leveraging trends allows you to use existing momentum to share your authentic brand voice. It lets you show some personality, get more exposure, and in my experience, is one of the most fun aspects of the app. And here\u0026rsquo;s my favorite benefit: It helps you diversify your content without having to come up with a unique video idea from scratch. Do you get a sense of the range of ways to adapt a trend to fit your business? I recommend checking this page each time you go to the app so you can see what\u0026rsquo;s new and timely, and know that some trends simply won\u0026rsquo;t jive with you or your work, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. But if one does grab your interest, here are a a few quick questions you can ask yourself What\u0026rsquo;s the core issue or experience being communicated in this trend? Does my audience deal with an experience like this? How can I show relatability or share resources or a solution when it comes to their experience? Remember, trends draw large audiences of highly engaged people. By getting involved, you can amplify your brand voice and bolster your reach. It\u0026rsquo;s time to make your presence felt. "

Automated tests are run against the newly integrated code to ensure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t break existing functionality. If tests fail, developers are notified immediately, and they can address issues before they become larger problems. Continuous Deployment (CD): Once code changes pass the CI phase, they\u0026rsquo;re automatically deployed to production or staging environments.

	"content": "Developing a content strategy Have you ever watched an enjoyable or compelling video and immediately thought, how did that creator come up with that on the spot? Here\u0026rsquo;s a news flash. For so many creators and business owners, great content is deliberate, it\u0026rsquo;s thought out, it\u0026rsquo;s often not improvised. Now that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean there\u0026rsquo;s not room for spontaneity as a business creator, but I want to encourage you to open yourself up to developing a content strategy. In other words, a plan for how to create a mix of different content. Remember, posting consistently on TikTok is one of the most important factors in keeping your videos flourishing and distributed. To help achieve that, I recommend planning out your content in two-week increments. From there, I like to break my content into three primary forms of content: Trends, which as you know, are things like hashtags and sounds already gaining momentum on TikTok. Evergreen, content that adds value on subjects that are always relevant and useful. And current news. For example, headlines or major announcements in an industry. I recommend devoting roughly 25% of your time to trends and news each, and 50% of your time on evergreen content. Here\u0026rsquo;s a look at what my content strategy looks like following this formula. By divvying up your content in this way, you create variety and originality in your videos. And don\u0026rsquo;t forget, within each category, you have the opportunity to mix things up even more For example, with my evergreen content, I might share tips speaking directly to the camera for one TikTok, but in another video showing an email hack, I might do a screen recording. Similarly, within a trend, I might do a simulated role play. While in another video, I might stitch my own idea together with another creator\u0026rsquo;s. The different ways to vary your content are limitless. Follow these content strategy techniques and you\u0026rsquo;ll ensure that your page stays in growth mode. As you strategize, keep in mind, you do not, I repeat, do not have to get it flawless. Instead, move forward and do it with speed. A good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow. Understand TikTok\u0026rsquo;s algorithm When I say algorithm, I mean the digital recommendation system that puts new videos in front of users.\nFor first-time users, the app asks you to select categories of interests, like pets or travel, to help tailor recommendations to your preferences.\nThis allows the app to develop an initial feed of recommended content, and it will start to polish and refine recommendations based on your interactions with an early set of videos.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to know what factors impact the algorithm so you can strengthen your TikTok strategy.\nKeep in mind, though, while there\u0026rsquo;s not one magic bullet to going viral on TikTok, understanding and leveraging TikTok\u0026rsquo;s algorithm preferences can really help expand your reach.\nThe first component of the algorithm to understand is user interactions.\nThese include the videos you like or share, accounts you follow, comments you post, and content you create. The second component of the algorithm that matters is video information.\nThese are things like hashtags, sounds, and the captions that go below your video. The third component that factors into the algorithm is device and account settings.\nThese are things like your language preference, country setting and device type. These factors are included to make sure the system is optimized for performance, but they receive lower weight in the recommendation system relative to other data points, since users don\u0026rsquo;t actively express these as preferences.\nKnowing that those factors matter, I encourage you to maximize the aspects you can control.\nFor example, adding hashtags thoughtfully to ensure the right people find your content and to jump into the pool of trends early on, or noticing the length of videos your audience most likes so you can replicate that length in the future.\nRemember, for both you and your audience, every new interaction helps the system learn about your interests and suggest content.\nSo the best way to curate your For You feed is to simply use and enjoy the app, to engage in content you\u0026rsquo;re drawn to, and to follow new accounts that you like\nOver time, your For You feed should increasingly be able to surface recommendations that are relevant to your interests.\nCreate best practices TikTok users aren\u0026rsquo;t expecting to have to rotate their screen to watch their next video. So the simple rule of thumb here is to capture your videos vertically. That allows you to take maximum advantage of TikTok\u0026rsquo;s full screen experience Use tripod Video resolution Audio : Tiktok library Video length TikTok reports that shorter videos perform better. In fact, one in four top performing videos have a duration between 21 and 34 seconds. Caption "
